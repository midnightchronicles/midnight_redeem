## ‚ú® Features

### üîê **Code Restrictions**  
Implement usage limits for your redeem codes. Each code can be configured for a specific number of uses, and critically, each player can redeem a code **only once**, ensuring fairness and preventing abuse.

### üìÜ **Expiry System (SQL-based)**  
Define the active lifespan of your redeem codes. Expiration is managed in **real-time** directly through your SQL database, providing precise control over code availability.

### üéí **Custom Rewards**  
Offer a diverse range of rewards to your players:
- üéÅ **Item Rewards:** Distribute in-game items with specified quantities (`item`, `amount`).
- üíµ **Money Rewards:** Grant in-game currency, with options for cash or bank deposits (`money`, `amount`, `option`).
- üöó **Vehicle Rewards:** Provide players with specific vehicles (`vehicle`, `model`).
- **Combined Rewards:** Create complex reward codes that combine multiple reward types simultaneously.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Bridge Integration**  
Fully compatible with [Community Bridge](https://github.com/The-Order-Of-The-Sacred-Framework/community_bridge), offering extensive flexibility:
- **Notification Systems:** Integrate with your preferred notification system.
- **Input Dialogs/Menus:** Utilize any input dialog or menu system for player interactions.
- **Inventory Systems:** Seamlessly connect with your existing inventory management.
- **Framework Agnostic:** Adaptable to your preferred server framework.

## üß© Reward Fields Explained
When creating a reward code, configure these fields to define its properties and rewards:

| Field         | Description                                        | Example                           |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |

## üìÑ Usage Examples

### Basic Example
This example demonstrates generating a redeem code with items, money, and a vehicle reward, limited to 3 uses and valid for 7 days.

```lua
exports['midnight_redeem']:GenerateRedeemCode(
    source,
    '[{"item":"bread","amount":5},{"money":true,"amount":1000,"option":"cash"},{"vehicle":true,"model":"adder"}]',
    "3",        -- Max uses
    "7",        -- Expiry in days
    "GIFT2025"  -- Custom code
)
```

### Dynamic From User Input
This example illustrates how to dynamically generate a redeem code based on user-provided inputs, such as player ID, reward structure, uses, expiry, and the custom code itself.

```lua
local playerId = source
local code = userProvidedCode
local uses = tostring(userProvidedUses)
local expiry = tostring(userProvidedDays)
local rewardsJson = json.encode(userProvidedRewards)

exports['midnight_redeem']:GenerateRedeemCode(
    source,         -- player ID
    rewardsJson,    -- reward structure (items, cash, etc.)
    uses,           -- max uses
    expiry,         -- expiry in days
    code            -- redeem code
)
```
## zdiscord integration

```
go to 'zdiscord_command_file' and copy generateredeem.js file
go to zdicord/server/commands and paste the file into the folder
make sure zdiscord is started after midnight_redeem
